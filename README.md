 💰 WealthWise Agent – AI-Powered Personal Finance Planner

WealthWise Agent is an AI-driven personal finance planning web app that helps individuals manage their money smarter. It applies the 50/30/20 budgeting rule (needs, wants, savings) while allowing customization, supports multiple financial goals, and suggests real-time investment opportunities.

With a sleek dark-themed Gradio interface, WealthWise Agent not only calculates your budget but also provides step-by-step reasoning, structured JSON output, and interactive charts for better financial visualization.
